A more suitable notation is called <b>postfix</b> expression. The <b>postfix</b> expression is of the form a b op. When an operator is followed for every pair of operands. This notation is easier todeal with as it allows the <b>operands</b> and <b>operators</b> to be added in stack like structures in a specific order. This means that \"1 + 1\" becomes \"1 1 +\""

    "\n",
    "This is the algorithm I will use to perform the expression translation to <b>postfix</b>. The details of the algorithm are illuminated in the comments that describe each step. Essentially it is forward traversal through all the tokens in the expression string, assigning them to either an operator stack or an output stack (holds the operands). Then, using the operator precedence rule some operators and popped to the end of the output stack and this is also the case when dealing with parenthesis, as they have a higher precedence than the four operators we are using. This gives the algorithm its \"shunting yard\" name as it is similar to the method in which trains and moved to seperate tracks. I have also added a check to ensure there are matching opening/closing parenthesis."

    "Finally we need a means to calculate the integer result from our postfix notation. This is trivial as we now simply pop the values from the output and if we have an operator and pair of operands the value is calculated. This value is then placed onto the result stack. If we discover an operand in the traversal this is simply placed back onto the result stack in anticipation of its correct operator. This ensures the operators act upon the correct operands as established by the shunting-yard algo."
