    "### 1.1 Problem Statement\n",
    "Write a program that can parse a simple integer arithmetic expression to give an integer result\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Example\n",
    "\"1 + 2 * 3\" should yield the answer 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Setup\n",
    "You must be able to run the program such that you can provide the name of a file with one expression per line and for each line output \"<expr> = <answer>\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 1.4 Conditions\n",
    "The expression should support operators +, -, *, /, integers, parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement and test your solution to illustrate how you would implement production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use 3rd party libraries to implement parts of your solution (e.g. a parser library) but you should not use a 3rd party library that provides the entire solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may implement this in any language, ideally .NET, with F#, but any is fine\n",
    "### 1.5 Submission\n",
    "Please submit via GitHub or a similar repository from which the solution can be downloaded."

    "\n",
    "Edsger Dijkstra developed his \"Shunting Yard\" algorithm to convert an infix expression into a postfix expression. It uses a stack; but in this case, the stack is used to hold operators rather than numbers. The purpose of the stack is to reverse the order of the operators in the expression. It also serves as a storage structure, since no operator can be printed until both of its operands have appeared.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Able to handle both negative and positive integers\n",
    "- The infix notation is parseable and in a consistent format\n",
    "- There is a single space between all values, operators and parenthesis"

    "Due to the aforementioned order of operation we need to modify the mathematical notation.\n",
    "In the problem statement we are given an expression written in the <b>infix</b> notation which has no notion of precedence. Moving to a new intermediate format called <b>postfix</b> is a standard way to address this.\n",

    "Using this approach the expression <b>[1 + 2 * 3]</b> becomes <b>[1 2 3 + *]</b> and by applying additional logic involving parenthesis and precedence it becomes a trivial closed-form solution with linear. The approach then is essentially to parse the expression, extract the values and operations into two arrays and evaluate."
