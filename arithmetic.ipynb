Then, using the operator precedence rule some operators and popped to the end of the outoput stack and this is also the case when dealing with parenthesis as they have a higher precedence than the four operators we are using. This gives the algorithm its \"shunting yard\" name as it is similar to the method in which trains and moved to seperate tracks.\n",
